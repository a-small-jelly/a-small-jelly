projects &amp; stuff

sometimes it feels self-indulgent to adapt things to make them easier for me to understand or absorb, so here is a place for those things.  i have adhd and easily become overstimulated, which sometimes creates a laser-focus, but usually makes it impossible to focus on anything at all. my instinct when i want to figure something out is to go search for a solution that already exists, and if there isn't one, make one. the most fun part of learning to program has been tailoring solutions to my own needs.

i may update projects later with better aesthetics, but everything for the time being is deliberately plain to avoid overstimulation.
