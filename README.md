projects &amp; stuff

Sometimes it feels self-indulgent to adapt things to make them easier for me to understand or absorb, so here is a place for those things.  I have ADHD and easily become overstimulated, which sometimes creates a laser-focus, but usually makes it impossible to focus on anything at all. My instinct when I want to figure something out is to go search for a solution that already exists, and if there isn't one, find one. The most fun part of learning to program has been tailoring solutions to my own needs.

I may update projects later with better aesthetics, but everything for the time being is intentionally as plain as possible to avoid overstimulation.

Thanks for checking this out!
